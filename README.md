# Purify Your Node

Disgusting shitcoiners have exploited a bug in Bitcoin and are spewing their sinful scams all over Bitcoin. This repo contains a script that will reject blocks containing their scams. 

Either update the default parameters in the script to your preferred settings, or pass command line options as so:
```
 bash geld.sh -u user -p password -c main -P 8443
```
